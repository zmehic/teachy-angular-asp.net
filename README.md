# teachy-angular and asp.net
My colleagues and I took part in this year's hackathon which was organized by our Local BEST Group in Mostar with the main focus of this year's theme being AI in Education. Our solution was a Learning Management System for schools and universities called "Teachy".

## What is "Teachy"?
"Teachy" uses AI to help teachers and students with everyday task they might encouter while using our Learning Management System. Tasks like creating and grading tests, finding answers to student questions and gaining insigts on test statistics are all automated for easier use and more efficient time management.
