# teachy-angular and asp.net
My colleagues and I took part in this year's hackathon, which was organized by our Local BEST Group in Mostar with the main focus of this year's theme being AI in Education. Our solution was a Learning Management System for schools and universities called "Teachy".

## What is "Teachy"?

"Teachy" uses AI (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to help teachers and students with everyday tasks they might encounter while using our Learning Management System. Tasks like creating and grading tests, finding answers to student questions, and gaining insights on test statistics are all automated for easier use and more efficient time management.

## Functionalities

### Teacher
Teacher's main focus is on managing class materials and tests. In regards to that the main funcionalities of this user type are:
  a) Class materials management;
  b) Test management;
  c) Test grading;

The teacher can, if they choose to do so, create tests automatically using AI, which takes an uploaded PDF file of a certain lecture and creates questions and answers based on the given material. After the exam is finished, the teacher can grade tests automatically, with Multiple Choice Multiple Answer (MCMA), Multiple Choice Single Answer (MCSA), and True/False questions being graded without AI, while the open-ended questions are being answered using AI. AI shares tips with the teacher by analyzing the results from tests taken by the students. If there happens to be any moment of uncertainty for the teacher, they can make use of a chatbot in the bottom-right corner of the page.

### Student
Student's main focus is on taking tests and analysing results. He can also make use of the built-in ChatBot.

## Presentation
You can check out the funcionalities mentioned above via this link, but there are some of the in-app images bellow for reference.


## Conclusion
This project aims to present some of the many opportunities AI creates for us, which we can use to make ourselves more productive. We hope that we've (to some extent) scratched the surface of what AI can bring to our education systems and have learned something new along the process.
